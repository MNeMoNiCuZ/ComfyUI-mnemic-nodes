> Added new Llama 3.2 vision model to the list, but this model is not yet officially available. Once it is, this should automatically work.

[Groq Vision Documentation](https://console.groq.com/docs/vision)

This node makes an API call to groq with an attached image and then uses Vision Language Models to return a description of the image, or answer to a question about the image in text format.

### Setup
You need to manually enter your [groq API key](https://console.groq.com/keys) into the `.env` file. A template file is provided and can be renamed to `.env` for use.

Currently, the Groq API can be used for free, with very friendly and generous [rate limits](https://console.groq.com/docs/rate-limits).

### Restrictions
**Image Size Limit**: The maximum allowed size for a request containing an image URL as input is 20MB. Requests larger than this limit will return a 400 error.

**Request Size Limit (Base64 Enconded Images)**: The maximum allowed size for a request containing a base64 encoded image is 4MB. Requests larger than this limit will return a 413 error.

### Example: Custom prompt
