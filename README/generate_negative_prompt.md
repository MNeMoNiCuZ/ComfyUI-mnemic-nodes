## â›” Generate Negative Prompt

> [!CAUTION]
> This node is highly experimental, and does not produce any useful result right now. It also requires you to download a specially trained model for it. It's just not worth the effort. It's mostly here to share a work in progress project.

This node utilizes a GPT-2 text inference model to generate a negative prompt that is supposed to enhance the aspects of the positive prompt.
