# ðŸ’¾ Save Text File With Path

This node is adapted and enhanced from the Save Text File node found in the [YMC GitHub ymc-node-suite-comfyui pack](https://github.com/YMC-GitHub/ymc-node-suite-comfyui).

The node can now give you a full file path output if you need it, as well as output the file-name as a separate output, in case you need it for something else.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> #### 2024-06-05 - Version 1.1.1
> The node was severely updated so existing workflows are going to break. I won't do another overhaul like this.
>
> The new node is more consistent in functionality and more intentional with the inputs and outputs.
>
> It now handles more edge cases and supports both a prefix, suffix, a dynamic counting with customizable separator before/after the counter in the right circumstances.
>
> Sorry for any troubles caused.
